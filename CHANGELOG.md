## [3.8.0] — 2026-03-20

### Added — Product Download System & Marketing Pages
- **Product pages**: 5 new routes (`/products/`, `/products/browser/`, `/products/pillars/`, `/products/wizardos/`, `/products/cluster/`) with premium landing design
- **Download lead capture API**: `POST /downloads/register` (public), `POST /downloads/waitlist` (public), `GET /downloads/products` (public catalog), `GET /downloads/admin/stats` (admin analytics), `GET /downloads/admin/export` (CSV export)
- **DownloadLead model**: `download_leads` table in public.db — tracks name, email, wallet, product, platform, referrer, IP hash, marketing consent, 384-dim semantic embeddings
- **DownloadModal component**: Two-mode popup (download / waitlist) with platform auto-detection, installation instructions, wallet address auto-pull, form validation
- **Lead analytics**: Admin dashboard "DOWNLOADS" tab with per-product stats, platform breakdown, lead table, CSV export
- **Semantic embeddings**: Download events embedded via sentence-transformers (384-dim) and stored for GROOT reasoning
- **Event bus**: `download.registered` and `download.waitlist` events published for real-time WS + webhook delivery
- **Netlify deployment**: `netlify.toml` with build config, SPA routing, security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP), binary caching
- **CORS**: Added `www.refinet.io`, `refinet.io`, `app.refinet.io` to production origins
- **Products in navbar**: PublicNavBar shows Browser/Pillars/WizardOS/Cluster links; AppShell sidebar has "Products" section with tab visibility gating
- **Pillars v0.3.0 assets**: Downloaded and served from `public-downloads/pillar/product/` (exe, dmg, AppImage, deb, tar.gz)
- **products.json**: Expanded from 2 to 4 products with download URLs and availability metadata

### Added — Shared Frontend Components (Performance Optimization)
- `frontend/hooks/useInView.ts` — Shared IntersectionObserver hook for scroll-triggered animations (extracted from 4 product pages)
- `frontend/components/AnimatedTerminal/` — Reusable animated terminal with configurable lines, timing, and cleanup
- `frontend/components/FeatureRow/` — Reusable alternating feature row with terminal snippet and scroll-reveal
- **Lazy loading**: MatrixRain and DownloadModal loaded via `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` — reduces initial JS bundle
- **Timer cleanup**: All setTimeout/setInterval refs properly cleaned on unmount

### Fixed
- **TabVisibilityPanel type error**: Fixed pre-existing type mismatch (`headers` prop declared as function but received as object) in admin page
- **Event bus async**: Fixed `_try_publish_event` in downloads route to use `asyncio.get_running_loop().create_task()` for proper async event publishing
- **Input validation**: Added `max_length` constraints to `referrer` (2048) and `eth_address` (42) in download schemas
- **DownloadModal cleanup**: Download trigger `setTimeout` now stores ref and clears on modal close/unmount

## [3.7.0] — 2026-03-20

### Added — SDK Gateway Skill (LLM-Free Contract Access)
- **New skill**: `skills/refinet-sdk-gateway/` — deterministic, LLM-free access to all public smart contract SDKs via MCP
- **4 new MCP tools** (22 total): `resolve_contract`, `fetch_sdk`, `list_chains_for_contract`, `bulk_sdk_export`
- `api/services/sdk_gateway.py` — core service: contract resolution by name/slug/address, multi-chain deployment lookup, paginated SDK catalog
- Automated workers: `sdk_sync_worker.py` (staleness detection + auto-regeneration), `sdk_indexer.py` (per-chain catalog builder)
- Usage feedback loop via `memory/working/sdk_queries.jsonl` — hot-contract detection, 30-day pruning
- Event bus cache invalidation on SDK/ABI/visibility changes
- Two core calls for agents: **contract address / network** lookup and **SDK fetch** — instant, no inference latency

### Added — XMTP-Encrypted Help Desk (Customer Support System)
- `SupportTicket` + `TicketMessage` models in `public.db` — status lifecycle: open → in_progress → waiting_on_user → resolved → closed
- `api/services/support.py` — 9 functions: create, list, reply, assign, close, update status, stats
- `api/routes/support.py` — 12 REST endpoints (6 user + 6 admin) at `/support/*`

- `api/middleware/tab_gate.py` — `TabGateMiddleware` with 30s in-memory cache, 16 gated route groups, 14 exempt prefixes
- Master admin always bypasses all gates — sees all tabs, accesses all routes regardless of visibility settings
- Frontend: `isTabVisible()` helper, `TAB_PATH_MAP` route guard, all 17 sidebar items + 5 top bar icons wrapped
- Admin panel: new "VISIBILITY" tab with toggle grid, save button, enabled/disabled counts

- Regenerative mission messaging throughout: "A new internet built to regenerate the world"
- Consistent teal branding (#5CE0D2) across all panels — removed off-brand matrix green (#00FF41) from browser section
- Transparent logo — removed black square background from `refi-logo.png`, removed `border-radius: 50%` / `rounded-full` from all 12 logo references

### Added — `/login` Route & Native Wallet Connection
- New `/login` page with lazy-loaded `AuthFlow` (page shell: 91.7 KB, wallet UI loads async)
- Native EIP-1193 + EIP-6963 wallet connection — zero third-party dependencies (no WalletConnect SDK)
- 10 wallet brands with real SVG logos: MetaMask, Rabby, Coinbase, Trust, Phantom, D'CENT, Trezor, Ledger, OKX, Brave
- Auto chain switching with `wallet_addEthereumChain` for XDC (50) and Avalanche Fuji (43113)
- `/settings` now redirects to `/login` (unauthenticated) or `/dashboard` (authenticated)

### Added — XDC Network & Avalanche Fuji Chain Support
- `api/auth/chains.py` — dynamic chain registry: queries `supported_chains` DB table, merges with hardcoded fallbacks
- XDC Network (chain 50) and Avalanche Fuji (chain 43113) added to both DB fallbacks and frontend wagmi config
- `DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID = 43113` (testing) — swap to `50` for XDC production
- `lib/wallet.ts` — added XDC and Avalanche Fuji to wagmi chain config with custom RPC endpoints

### Added — Centralized SPA Auth Guard
- Single auth guard in `client-layout.tsx` replaces 14 per-page `window.location.href` redirects
- Protected routes redirect to `/` (home) — not `/login` — preventing crash loops
- Global transition overlay (z-index 99999) during login/logout — eliminates skeleton flash
- All navigation uses `router.push()` / `router.replace()` — zero full-page reloads

### Added — Dark Theme Lock
- Landing page, login page: always dark, no toggle, `ForceDarkTheme` component
- Dashboard: starts dark every session, user can toggle to light (not persisted)
- `ThemeProvider` defaults to dark on mount, no localStorage read
- HTML `<html data-theme="dark">` set at SSR level
- All loading screens use hardcoded `#050505` background

### Fixed — Database Schema Migration
- Added 11 missing columns to `users` table: `auth_layer_1_completed_at`, `auth_layer_2_completed_at`, `auth_layer_3_completed_at`, `onboarding_completed_at`, `marketing_consent`, `marketing_consent_at`, `cifi_verified`, `cifi_username`, `cifi_verified_at`, `cifi_kyc_level`, `cifi_display_name`
- Migration saved: `migrations/public/019_users_onboarding_cifi.sql`

### Fixed — Build Errors & SPA Routing
- `app/agents/page.tsx` — type error on `data.soul_md` (added `Record<string, string>` annotation)
- `app/store/[...slug]` — converted from catch-all to `[slug]` with `generateStaticParams` + `dynamicParams = true` for static export compatibility
- CORS: added `localhost:4001` to allowed origins for dev
- WagmiProvider moved to wrap only authenticated AppShell — public pages load without wallet overhead

### Performance
- Login page: 220 KB → 91.7 KB (AuthFlow lazy-loaded via `dynamic()`)
- All panel CTAs: `<a href>` → `<Link prefetch>` (client-side SPA navigation)
- Nonce prefetched during login page load for faster SIWE signing
- WagmiProvider scoped to authenticated pages only

### Tests
- **270/270 passing** (214 API + 56 skills) — zero regressions
